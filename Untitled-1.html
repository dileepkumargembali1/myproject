                    You have a right to “Karma” (actions) but never to any Fruits thereof. You should never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should there be any attachment in not doing your prescribed activities.</p>

                <p>For our needs Krishna has already provided everything. We just have to use it judiciously. If we look around, we will find that food, clothing and shelter are easily available. Water is available almost everywhere. These basic needs are provided by nature to us who works as per the wishes of Krishna.

                    However, these days, we have to struggle very hard to satisfy even our basic needs. Earlier food was not sold in the market. But today not just food but even water is sold in the market. To drink pure water, one has to pay money.
                    
                    I heard that once few western devotees came to Vrindavan.  They wanted to buy milk. They went to the vrajvasis and asked them, “We want milk. Please tell how much it costs per litre?” Vrajvasis started looking each other’s face.
                    
                    One of them said to the devotees, “We do not sell milk in Vrindavan. You can take as much as you want and for that you do not have to pay anything.” This may have happened around 50-60 years ago. Selling milk, selling water was almost unheard-of. Because whatever is needed for our living has been provided by Krishna.
                    
                    Today because of wanton greed people have exploited nature and have commercialised everything, so there are scarcity of resources and people are deprived of even basic needs.
                    
                    This is why it is said that there are enough in this world for a man’s need but not for man’s greed.
                    
                    Now let us see how material desires causes lots of suffering and heartburn.
                    
                    Material Desires are difficult to fulfil
                    It is easy to desire big. In fact, anyone can desire big but to fulfil those desires it takes lots of efforts. One has to slog hard like an animal.
                    
                    In Srimad Bhagavatam 4.30.30, it is mentioned, apavarga-gurur gatiḥ. Apavarga means liberation. Opposite of apavarga is pavarga which means material existence. In Sanskrit there are five vargas – ka-varga, ca – varga, ṭa-varga, ta-varga, pa-varga. Pa-varga has five letters – pa, pha, ba, bha, ma.
                    
                    pa stands for parisrama (hard work),  pha for fena ( foam), ba for vyartha (useless), bha for bhaya(fear) and ma for mrityu (death).
                    
                    Pavarga as explained by Srila Prabhupada, founder acharya of Iskcon
                    Srila Prabhupada has very nicely explained the word pavarga. Let us discuss.
                    
                    To fulfil any desire, one has to work extremely hard which is represented by the letter, pha, which stands for parisrama (hard work).
                    
                    Now if one works very hard then one starts frothing from the mouth i.e. foam comes from the mouth which is represented by the letter, pha, which stands for fena (foam). Sometimes we might have seen horses, donkeys or oxen frothing because of hard labour.
                    
                    But in spite of hard work, most of the time we may not be able to achieve what we want and even if we are successful in achieving what we want, we find that it does not satiate our heart which leads to frustration. So, all the hard work for material desires is useless which is represented by the letter, ba, which stands for vyartha (useless).
                    
                    Also, in this world most of the time we live in bhaya(fear) which is represented by the letter, bha. We fear losing our money, our job, our loved ones and we also fear for our life.</p>
